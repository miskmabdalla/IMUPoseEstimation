Using HALPE_26 model (body and feet) for pose estimation.

Valid MPS installation found: using ONNXRuntime backend with GPU.

Pose tracking set up for "Body_with_feet" model.
Mode: balanced.

Persons are detected every 4 frames and tracked inbetween. Multi-person is not selected. Tracking is done with sports2d.
keypoint_likelihood_threshold=0.3, average_likelihood_threshold=0.5, keypoint_number_threshold=0.3
Skipping right wrist angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the model: ['RElbow', 'RWrist', 'RIndex'].
Skipping left wrist angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the model: ['LElbow', 'LWrist', 'LIndex'].

Video processing completed.
Processed video saved to /Users/whiskymisky/masters/Sports2D_results/trial_4_Sports2D/trial_4_Sports2D.mp4.

Post-processing pose:
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Pose in pixels saved to /Users/whiskymisky/masters/Sports2D_results/trial_4_Sports2D/trial_4_Sports2D_px_person00.trc.

Converting pose to meters:
Using height of person #0 (1.65m) to convert coordinates in meters. Floor angle: auto (estimation: 26.03°), xy_origin: auto (estimation: [0, 1355]) px.
- Person 0: Seen from the front.
Pose in meters saved to /Users/whiskymisky/masters/Sports2D_results/trial_4_Sports2D/trial_4_Sports2D_m_person00.trc. 

Post-processing angles (without inverse kinematics):
- Person 0: Interpolating missing sequences if they are smaller than 10 frames. Large gaps filled with last_value.
Filtering with Butterworth filter, 4th order, 6 Hz.
Correcting segment angles by removing the 26.03° floor angle.
